# Meeting & Development Notes

## January 12, 2024 - WebSocket Troubleshooting Session

### Summary
Attempted to resolve WebSocket error 4700 but made several missteps:
- Unnecessarily modified working OAuth scopes
- Made circular changes without progress
- Failed to follow systematic debugging approach

### Key Learnings
1. Stick to working configurations:
   - OAuth scopes are correct (meeting:read, meeting:write, webinar:read, webinar:write, websocket)
   - Don't modify working token storage
   - Keep WebSocket URL as `wss://ws.zoom.us/ws`

2. Development Process Issues:
   - Need better adherence to project documentation
   - Avoid circular troubleshooting
   - Follow systematic debugging approach

### Next Steps
1. Contact Zoom support about error 4700
2. Document all attempted solutions
3. Keep OAuth configuration stable
4. Focus on WebSocket connection logs

### Action Items
- [ ] Create Zoom support ticket for error 4700
- [ ] Document all WebSocket connection attempts
- [ ] Review Zoom WebSocket documentation thoroughly
- [ ] Implement comprehensive WebSocket error logging
